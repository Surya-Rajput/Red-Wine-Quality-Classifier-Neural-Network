# Red-Wine-Quality-Classifier-Neural-Network

This repository contains a project focused on implementing a red wine quality classifier using neural networks. The goal of the project is to build and evaluate classifiers for determining the quality of red wine based on various features.


## Task

The project tasks are outlined as follows:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform EDA on the dataset.
- Explore the features using histograms.
- Conduct any necessary data preprocessing.

### 2. Neural Network Implementation with TF Estimator DNN Classifier
- Implement a neural network classifier using TF Estimator's DNN Classifier.

### 3. Neural Network Implementation with TF.Keras
- Implement a neural network classifier using TF.Keras.
- Plot training loss and validation loss.
- Plot training accuracy and validation accuracy.

### 4. Observations and Conclusion
- Provide observations and reasoning throughout the analysis.
- Include a conclusion section at the end of the notebook.
